# AI Reference Checker

AI Reference Checker automates citation validation for AI-generated content and academic research. It uses a custom model trained on a reference dataset to compare citation statements to source texts. This tool accelerates verification, improves accuracy, and provides contextual snippets for deeper understanding, transforming manual processes into an efficient automated workflow.
